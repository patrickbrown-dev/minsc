** Installation

Add this line to your ~Gemfile~.

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
gem "minsc", "~> 0.1.0"
#+END_SRC

** Usage

First, define some rules.

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
class AttackRule
  include Minsc::Rule

  condition :is_near_an_enemy?

  def initialize(character)
    @character = character
  end

  def execute
    @character.attack!(@character.enemies.first)
  end

  private

  def is_near_an_enemy?
    @character.enemies.count > 0
  end
end

class RageRule
  include Minsc::Rule

  condition :is_hp_below_25?
  condition :is_near_an_enemy?

  def initialize(character)
    @character = character
  end

  def execute
    @character.rage!
  end

  private

  def is_hp_below_25?
    @character.hp < 25
  end

  def is_near_an_enemy?
    @character.enemies.count > 0
  end
end
#+END_SRC

Then assign the rules to a ~RulesEngine~.

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
class BarbarianRulesEngine
  include Minsc::RulesEngine

  rule RageRule
  rule AttackRule
end
#+END_SRC

Finally, execute the ~RulesEngine~ on some state. The ~RulesEngine~ will perform
/all/ actions it meets the criteria for.

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
barbarian = Character.new("Minsc")
BarbarianRulesEngine.execute(barbarian)
# If near an enemy and has less than 25 health, Minsc will #rage!.
# If near an enemy Minsc will #attack!.
# If near an enemy and has less than 25 health, Minsc will #rage! and #attack!
# If not near an enemy, Minsc will do nothing (perhaps pet Boo).
#+END_SRC
